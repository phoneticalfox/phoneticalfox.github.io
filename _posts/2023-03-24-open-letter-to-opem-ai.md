# an open letter

So, here I am, shouting into the void, with nobody around to hear my pitch for a better version of DALL-E 2. But hey, who knows? Maybe someone will stumble upon this post and think, "Wow, she has a great idea! We should totally implement that!" And then the world will be a better place for it. Or, more likely, this post will just float around in the vast sea of the internet, unread and forgotten. But hey, a girl can dream, can't she?

## the letter

Dear OpenAI Team,

I am writing to you with an exciting proposal that could take your already impressive DALL-E 2 model to the next level. DALL-E 2 has made significant strides in image generation capabilities, but I believe there is still room for growth. As you know, one of the limitations of the current model is its reliance on a fixed dataset of images. While this dataset is vast, it is still finite, which means that DALL-E 2 can only generate images that already exist in the dataset.

To solve this problem, I propose integrating DALL-E 2 with a self-hosted image search engine, such as Searxng. By doing so, DALL-E 2 would be able to access a wider variety of images, expanding its capabilities and generating even more impressive and unique images.

The benefits of this integration are numerous. By allowing DALL-E 2 to access a larger pool of images, the model would be able to generate a more diverse range of images, some of which may not have been possible with the current dataset. This would lead to more creative and innovative outputs, further solidifying DALL-E 2's position as a cutting-edge image generation model.

In addition to expanding the scope of possible images, integrating a self-hosted image search engine would also ensure that the images used by DALL-E 2 are fresh and up-to-date. The current dataset may contain images that are outdated or overused, which can limit the model's capabilities. With a self-hosted image search engine, DALL-E 2 would have access to new and current images, providing even more opportunities for creative expression.

Now, let's talk about how this integration could be achieved. The first step would be to set up a self-hosted container image of Searxng, which can be done relatively easily. Once the container image is running, the DALL-E 2 model can be modified to query the Searxng image search API for images based on the input text. The model would then parse the results and generate an image based on the top hits from multiple search engines.

I believe this integration would be a game-changer for DALL-E 2 and would push the boundaries of what is possible with image generation. It would also allow OpenAI to continue to lead the way in AI innovation and make significant strides in creative expression.

I hope you will consider this proposal and look forward to hearing your thoughts on this exciting possibility.

Sincerely,

Phonetic
