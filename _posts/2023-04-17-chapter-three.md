From the Offices of Jack Martin
Governor of Montana
State Capitol, Helena

To Whom It May Concern:

We are writing to demand the immediate removal of the TikTok app from your app store™ in the state of Montana. This request is made on the grounds that the app is in violation of a recently passed state law, which prohibits the collection of personal data without the user's express consent.

TikTok has been found to be collecting and using personal data without the knowledge or consent of its users, in violation of our state law. This is a serious breach of privacy, and we cannot allow it to continue.

We demand that you take immediate action to remove the TikTok app from your app store™ in Montana. Failure to do so will result in legal action against your company.

Sincerely,

Jack Martin
Governor of Montana

Subject: Urgent Security Measures

Dear Board Members,

As you are aware, we have received a cease and desist letter from the Governor of Montana, Jack Martin, demanding the removal of the TikTok app from our app store in Montana. While Governor Martin's letter is in line with Montana's recently passed privacy law, it is our belief that his request is misguided and poses a serious threat to our company.

Removing TikTok from our app store in Montana would set a dangerous precedent and invite further government interference in our business operations. We cannot let this stand. Instead, I propose that we take additional measures to protect our company and our employees.

First, I suggest we deploy additional security measures on our internal network to prevent any outside intrusion. This would include increasing our intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and anti-malware software to prevent any malicious attacks from infiltrating our systems.

Second, I propose that we begin secretly fortifying Apple HQ and building a private army to protect ourselves against any potential threats. This would ensure that we are not caught off guard and can respond swiftly to any threats to our company or our people.

I understand that this may seem extreme, but I assure you that it is necessary. We cannot allow Governor Martin or any other government entity to dictate our business practices. It is our responsibility to protect our company and our employees from any external threats.

I have already spoken with Thomas Lancaster, our head of security, about implementing these measures. He has assured me that he can oversee the deployment of these security measures without any disruption to our operations.

To ensure the security of this communication, I have attached a PGP-signed document detailing the specific security measures we will be implementing to protect our company.

Please let me know your thoughts on this matter.

Sincerely,

Serenity Chen
Apple CEO
