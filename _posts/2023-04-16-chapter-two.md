Chapter 2: The First Sign of Trouble

The next morning, I awoke to find myself alone in bed. It was still dark outside, and I felt a sense of unease. I sat up and looked around the room crying out for my darling Ashley, but she was nowhere to be found.

I grabbed my black kitten stuffed animal that Ashley had won for me on our first date, and clutched her tightly as I got out of bed. I crept down the hallway, trying not to make any noise, and found Ashley sitting in the living room.

“Hey, babe,” I said softly, relieved to see her. “What are you doing up so early?”

Ashley looked up at me, and I could see the worry in her eyes. “I don’t know, I just had a weird feeling,” she replied. “I couldn’t sleep, so I came out here to clear my head.”

I walked over and cuddled up next to her. She took my hand just the same as she had when she proposed to me, as she held and comforted me, we snuggled in silence, watching the stars outside the window. I could feel the tension in her body, and I knew that something was bothering her.

“Is everything okay, Ash?” I asked, kissing her cheek softly.

She stroked my hair, and I could see the worry in her eyes. “I don’t know, sweetie,” she said. “I just have this feeling that something bad is going to happen.”

I wrapped my arms around her, holding her close. “We’ll face whatever comes our way together, Ash,” I whispered. “I’m here for you, no matter what.”

We sat there for a while longer, holding each other until dawn. Despite the unease that lingered in the air, we were happy, we could always comfort each other.

As the sun began to rise, we went back to bed, and Ashley held me close as I drifted off to sleep, safe in her arms. I knew that whatever was coming our way, we would face it together, and our love would be enough to get us through anything.

The next day was Sunday, and Ashley and I went grocery shopping and ran some errands together. I was so preoccupied with spending as much time as possible with her before she would leave me for work in the morning that I almost forgot about the previous night.

I was my usual extra clingy self, but Ash never seemed to really mind, instead she just called me adorable. She was always just extra affectionate to me, on those days. I could tell that she was feeling way better too.

As we finished our errands, Ash took us out to the best restaurant ever. We had a blast playing arcade games and eating delicious food. I was so happy to be with her, and it felt like nothing could bring me down.

She drove us home and the next thing I remember was her climbing into bed, I snuggled up to her and soon I was fast asleep in her arms.
