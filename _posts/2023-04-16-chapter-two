Chapter 2: The First Sign of Trouble

The next morning, I woke up to find myself alone in bed. It was still dark outside, and I felt a sense of unease. I sat up and looked around the room, but Ashley was nowhere to be found.

I grabbed my black kitten stuffed animal that Ashley had won for me on our first date, and clutched it tightly as I got out of bed. I crept down the hallway, trying not to make any noise, and found Ashley sitting in the living room.

“Hey, babe,” I said softly, relieved to see her. “What are you doing up so early?”

Ashley looked up at me, and I could see the worry in her eyes. “I don’t know, I just had a weird feeling,” she replied. “I couldn’t sleep, so I came out here to clear my head.”

I walked over to her and sat down beside her on the couch. She took my hand, and we sat there in silence, watching the stars outside the window. I could feel the tension in her body, and I knew that something was bothering her.

“Is everything okay, Ash?” I asked, rubbing her hand.

She turned to me, and I could see the fear in her eyes. “I don’t know, Sarah,” she said. “I just have this feeling that something bad is going to happen.”

I wrapped my arms around her, holding her close. “We’ll face whatever comes our way together, Ash,” I whispered. “I’m here for you, no matter what.”

We sat there for a while longer, holding each other, and talking about our hopes and dreams. Despite the unease that lingered in the air, we were happy, and our love for each other was stronger than ever.

As the sun began to rise, we went back to bed, and I held Ashley close as we drifted off to sleep. I knew that whatever was coming our way, we would face it together, and our love would be enough to get us through anything.
