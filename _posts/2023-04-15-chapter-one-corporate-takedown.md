I woke up to the sound of birds chirping outside the window. I opened my eyes and saw my girlfriend, Ashley, still sleeping beside me. Her peaceful expression made my heart flutter. I loved Ashley with all my heart, and it was moments like this that made me feel complete.

"Good morning, my love," I whispered, caressing Ashley's cheek. She stirred, opening her eyes to look at me. "Good morning, gorgeous," she replied, a smile spreading across her face.

We lay there, holding each other, exchanging sweet nothings and professing our love. We had been together for two years, and yet, it felt like we were still in the honeymoon phase. We knew each other so well and were always in sync. I couldn't imagine life without Ashley.

Eventually, we got out of bed, hand in hand, and made our way to the kitchen. We put on some music and started making breakfast together, laughing and joking as we did. The aroma of pancakes and coffee filled the air, and I couldn't help but feel grateful for this moment.

As we sat down to eat, I looked at Ashley and said, "You know, every day I wake up next to you, I feel like the luckiest person in the world. I love you more than anything."

Ashley's eyes filled with tears, and she leaned over to kiss me. "I love you too, Sarah Lancaster. You're my everything," she replied, her voice choked with emotion.

In that moment, I knew that everything was perfect. I had Ashley, our cozy ranch, and a peaceful life. I didn't need anything else.
