Chapter Four: A Shattered Peace

After Ashley left for work at her law firm, I started to do some chores around the house. As I was wiping down the counters, I heard my phone buzz. It was a message from Akiko, my pen pal and BFF. We chatted for a while, catching up on our lives and sharing funny stories.

As we talked, I decided to go outside and enjoy the nice weather. I headed out to the rope swing by the pond that Ashley and I had hung up in the tree when we first moved in. I sat down on the swing and continued my conversation with Akiko.

When suddenly, I noticed a group of men in suits gathering in front of the gate. I was taken aback, wondering who they could be and why they were here. As I watched, the men started talking to each other in hushed tones.

I tried to focus on my conversation with Akiko, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. As the men turned towards me, I realized that they were looking right at me. One man in a gray suit stepped forward.

"Excuse me, are you the owner of this property?" he shouted, his tone polite but firm.

I replied nervously, "No, I'm not. My wife and I are just renting this place."

"I'm sorry to inform you, but this property has been sold to a corporate interest. All current tenants have 24 hours to pack up their belongings and vacate the premises," the man said, his voice devoid of any emotion.

My heart sank. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I had grown to love this place, and the thought of leaving it behind was devastating. As the man handed me a piece of paper and walked away, I sat there on the swing, tears streaming down my face. My peaceful life had just been shattered, and I had no idea what to do next.
